# COMP90042 Project Description

Please check the **lecture recording first** if you have any questions about Assignment 3 – Project (**Lecture 14, Friday, 24 April 2026**).

This assignment is to be completed in teams of three (3). We strongly encourage effective and respectful collaboration. Please refer to the [University of Melbourne Working in Groups Guide](https://students.unimelb.edu.au/academic-skills/resources/communicating-in-class/communicating-with-peers/working-in-groups).  

If a team member is not contributing adequately, please contact the lecturer ([Dr. Caren Han](mailto:caren.han@unimelb.edu.au?subject=[COMP90042]%20Project%20Group)) with a clear description of each member’s contributions. We strongly recommend starting early to allow sufficient time to identify challenges and seek support when needed.

You are free to design your system using any of the techniques covered in lectures and labs, provided that they comply with the **Project Rules (see the Important Notes section below).**

For training and evaluation, a benchmark dataset is provided with training, validation, and test splits. You should use the training and validation sets for model development and tuning, and the test set only for final leaderboard submission.

For this assignment, **your primary goal is not simply to achieve the highest performance, but to demonstrate thoughtful system design and clear reasoning behind your choices**. You are encouraged to explore novel approaches, justify your design decisions, and critically analyse your results.  

**NOTE: Grading will primarily focus on your research process, methodological soundness, and clarity of analysis**, rather than raw system performance (see grading details below).

|-----------------------------------------|

The impact of climate change on humanity is a significant concern. However, the increase in unverified statements regarding climate science has led to a distortion of public opinion, underscoring the importance of conducting fact-checks on claims related to climate science. Consider the following claim and related evidence:

**Claim**: The Earth’s climate sensitivity is so low that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 will result in a surface temperature change on the order of 1°C or less.

**Evidence:**

1. In his first paper on the matter, he estimated that global temperature would rise by around 5 to 6 °C (9.0 to 10.8 °F) if the quantity of CO 2 was doubled.
2. The 1990 IPCC First Assessment Report estimated that equilibrium climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 lay between 1.5 and 4.5 °C (2.7 and 8.1 °F), with a "best guess in the light of current knowledge" of 2.5 °C (4.5 °F).

It should not be difficult to see that the claim is not supported by the evidence passages, and assuming the source of the evidence is reliable, such a claim is misleading. 

### Task Description

The goal of this project is to develop an automated fact-checking system.  
Given a claim, your system must:

1. **Retrieve** the most relevant evidence passages from a corpus (the *knowledge source* - evidence.json), and  
2. **Classify** the claim based on the retrieved evidence into one of the following labels:  
   `{SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT_ENOUGH_INFO, DISPUTED}`  

More concretely, you will be provided a list of claims and a corpus containing a large number of evidence passages (the “knowledge source”), and your system must: (1) search for the most related evidence passages from the knowledge source given the claim; and (2) classify the status of the claim given the evidence in the following 4 classes: {SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT_ENOUGH_INFO, DISPUTED}. 

To build a successful system, it must be able to retrieve the correct set of evidence passages and classify the claim correctly.


Besides system implementation, you must also write a report that describes your fact-checking system, e.g. how the retrieval and classification components work, the reason behind the choices you made and the system’s performance. We hope that you will enjoy the project. To make it more engaging, **we will run the task as a leaderboard (participation is optional; more details below)**. You will be competing with other students in the class. The following sections give more details on the data format, system evaluation, grading scheme and use of the leaderboard. Your assessment will be graded based on your report, and your code.



### Project Components
You are provided with several files for the project:
* [train-claims,dev-claims].json: JSON files for the labelled training and development set; 
* [test-claims-unlabelled].json: JSON file for the unlabelled test set;
* dev-claims-baseline.json: JSON file containing predictions of a baseline system on the development set;
* evidence.json: JSON file containing a number of evidence passages (i.e. the “knowledge source”); 
* eval.py: Python script to evaluate system performance (see “Evaluation” below for more details).

### Data Format
For the labelled claim files (train-claims.json, dev-claims.json), each instance contains the claim ID, claim text, claim label (one of the four classes: {SUPPORTS, REFUTES, NOT_ENOUGH_INFO, DISPUTED}), and a list of evidence IDs. The unlabelled claim file (test-claims-unlabelled.json) has a similar structure, except that it only contains the claim ID and claim text. More concretely, the labelled claim files has the following format:

```
{
  "claim-2967":
  {
    claim_text: "[South Australia] has the most expensive electricity in the world."
    claim_label: "SUPPORTS"
    evidences: ["evidence-67732", "evidence-572512"]
  },
  "claim-375":
  ...
}
```

The list of evidence IDs (e.g. evidence-67732, evidence-572512) are drawn from the evidence passages in evidence.json:

```
{
  "evidence-0": "John Bennet Lawes, English entrepreneur and agricultural scientist",
  "evidence-1": "Lindberg began his professional career at the age of 16, eventually ...",
  ...
}
```

Given a claim (e.g. claim-2967), your system needs to search and retrieve a list of the most relevant evidence passages from evidence.json, and classify the claim (1 out of the 4 classes mentioned above). You should retrieve at least one evidence passage. So, for each claim, your system must:
- Retrieve **at least one** relevant evidence passage  
- Predict the correct claim label  

### Data Usage Guidelines
- The **training set** (train-claims.json) should be used for building your models, e.g. for use in development of features, rules and heuristics, and for supervised/unsupervised learning. You are encouraged to inspect this data closely to fully understand the task.
- The **development set** (dev-claims.json) is formatted like the training set. This will help you make major implementation decisions (e.g. choosing optimal hyper-parameter configurations), and should also be used for detailed analysis of your system — both for measuring performance and for error analysis — in the report.
- You will use the **test set (test-claims-unlabelled.json)** to participate in the leaderboard **(optional)**. For this reason, no labels (i.e. the evidence passages and claim labels) are provided for this partition. You are allowed (and encouraged) to train your final system on both the training and development set so as to maximise performance on the test set, but you should not at any time manually inspect the test dataset; any sign that you have done so will result in loss of marks. In terms of the format of the system output, we have provided dev-claims-predictions.json for this. 
**Note: you’ll notice that it has the same format as the labelled claim files (train-claims.json or dev-claims.json), although the claim_text field is optional (i.e. we do not use this field during evaluation) and you’re free to omit.**

| :exclamation:  You need to put the code that you conduct all actions for this section in the [ipynb template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CjlVXdEsioH_iGOHUbmrhimTLRXGJIt0?usp=sharing) |
|-----------------------------------------|

### You MUST follow the rules below. Any team found to violate these rules will receive **zero marks** for the project.

### 1) Model Design

You are encouraged to explore different models for the task.  
Your system MUST include at least one sequence modelling component based on one of the following architectures: RNN, LSTM, GRU, or Transformer.

You may use deep learning libraries (e.g., PyTorch) to implement these components (i.e., you do not need to implement them from scratch).  

You are encouraged to read relevant publications to guide your design. However, **you MUST NOT directly copy open-source project code** (e.g., from GitHub or published repositories). Your system must be implemented by your team.

### 2) Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
You are allowed to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as part of your system, provided that the following conditions are met:

- **Only open-source models are allowed.**  
  You MUST NOT use any closed-source APIs or proprietary systems (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot).
- **Models must be runnable on the free version of Google Colab.**  
  This means:
  - The model must fit within standard Colab resource limits (e.g., ~12GB RAM)
  - It must run without requiring paid APIs or external compute
- **You may use LLMs in any way**, including:
  - prompting / in-context learning  
  - fine-tuning  
  - parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., LoRA)  
  - integration into hybrid architectures  
- **However, your contribution must be clear and substantial.**  
  Simply using an off-the-shelf model (e.g., prompting a pretrained LLM without modification or design justification) will **not** be sufficient for full marks.
- You must clearly describe in your report:
  - how the LLM is used  
  - what design decisions you made (e.g., model selection, training strategy, system architecture) and why 
  - and what your **technical contribution** is beyond the base model  
- We strongly encourage designing **hybrid systems** (e.g., retrieval + LLM, or structured reasoning + LLM) rather than relying solely on a single pretrained model.

### 3) Prohibited Methods
You **MUST NOT** use:
- Any closed-source APIs or models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3/4, Claude, Gemini, Copilot)  
- Any hand-crafted if-then rules for classification or prediction logic  

### 4) Libraries and Code Usage
The following libraries **are allowed**:
- Deep learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras  
- HuggingFace Transformers (for model loading, training, and inference)  
- Standard Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- NLP toolkits (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)

You may use **the code provided in workshops** 

You **MUST NOT** use or submit external project implementations (e.g., copying full solutions or repositories from GitHub).
You may refer to external resources for understanding or inspiration, but your final system must be implemented by your team.


### 5) Reproducibility
The model described in your report **MUST match** your submitted code and results.  

You MUST include:
- Running logs  
- Reported results  

in your submitted `.ipynb` file.

### 6) Integrity

You **MUST NOT** submit results that were not generated by your final submitted code.  

**Post-hoc modifications (e.g., manual edits to predictions)** are strictly prohibited.


### 7) Compute Constraints

You **MUST NOT** use models that cannot be run on the free version of Google Colab.


### 8) Code Template

You **MUST** use the provided [ipynb template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CjlVXdEsioH_iGOHUbmrhimTLRXGJIt0?usp=sharing).  
You **may extend or restructure it, but core components** must remain intact for grading compatibility.


### 9) Data Usage

You **MUST use only the provided training and development datasets** for model training, tuning, and evaluation.

You **MUST NOT** use any additional external datasets for training or evaluation.

The use of **pretrained open-source models (e.g., LLMs)** is allowed, provided they comply with the LLM usage rules above.

**IMPORTANT: please make sure that you check the IMPORTANT NOTES**

### Evaluation Overview
We provide a script (eval.py) for evaluating your system. This script takes two input files, the ground truth and your predictions, and computes three metrics: (1) F-score for evidence retrieval; (2) accuracy for claim classification; and (3) harmonic mean of the evidence retrieval F-score and claim classification accuracy. Shown below is the output from running predictions of a baseline system on the development set:

```
$ python eval.py --predictions dev-claims-baseline.json --groundtruth dev-claims.json
Evidence Retrieval F-score (F)    = 0.3377705627705628
Claim Classification Accuracy (A) = 0.35064935064935066
Harmonic Mean of F and A          = 0.3440894901357093
```
### Metric Definitions

The **three metrics** are computed as follows:

1. **Evidence Retrieval F-score (F)**: computes how well the evidence passages retrieved by the system match the ground truth evidence passages. For each claim, our evaluation considers all the retrieved evidence passages, computes the precision, recall and F-score by comparing them against the ground truth passages, and aggregates the F-scores by averaging over all claims. e.g. given a claim if a system retrieves the following set {evidence-1, evidence-2, evidence-3, evidence-4, evidence-5}, and the ground truth set is {evidence-1, evidence-5, evidence-10}, then precision = 2/5, recall = 2/3, and F-score = 1/2. The aim of this metric is to measure how well the retrieval component of your fact checking system works.

2. **Claim Classification Accuracy (A)**: computes standard classification accuracy for claim label prediction, ignoring the set of evidence passages retrieved by the system. This metric assesses solely how well the system classifies the claim, and is designed to understand how well the classification component of your fact checking system works.

3. **Harmonic Mean of F and A**: computes the harmonic mean of the evidence retrieval F-score and claim classification accuracy. Note that this metric is computed at the end after we have obtained the aggregate (over all claims) F-score and accuracy. This metric is designed to assess both the retrieval and classification components of your system, and as such will be used as **the main metric for ranking systems on the leaderboard.**

The first two metrics (F-score and accuracy) are provided to help diagnose and develop your system. While they are not used to rank your system on the leaderboard, you should document them in your report and use them to discuss the strengths/weaknesses of your system.

A strong system should balance both retrieval quality and classification performance.

### Baseline System
The example prediction file, dev-claims-baseline.json, is the output of a baseline system on the development set. This file will help you understand the required file format for creating your development output (for tuning your system using eval.py) and your test output (for submission to the Leaderboard).

Note that this is not a realistic baseline, and you might find that your system performs worse than it. The reason for this is that this baseline constructs its output in the following manner: (1) the claim labels are randomly selected; and (2) the set of evidence passages combines several randomly selected ground truth passages and several randomly selected passages from the knowledge source. We created such a ‘baseline’ because a true random baseline that selects a random set of evidence passages will most probably produce a zero F-score for evidence retrieval (and consequently zero for the harmonic mean of F-score and accuracy), and it won’t serve as a good diagnostic example to explain the metrics. To clarify, this baseline will not be used in any way for ranking submitted systems on the leaderboard, and is provided solely to illustrate the metrics and an example system output.

| :exclamation:  You MUST use the [ACL template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) when writing your report.
|-----------------------------------------|

You must use LATEX for writing your report. You must include your group number under the title (using the \author field in LATEX).  
Make sure to change the template setting from `\usepackage[review]{acl}` to `\usepackage[final]{acl}` to generate the final version. 
We will not accept reports that are longer than the stated limits below, or otherwise violate the style requirements.

The report should be submitted as a PDF and contain **no more than seven(7)** pages of content, excluding team contribution and references. An appendix is NOT allowed. Therefore, you should carefully consider the information you want to include in the report to build a coherent and concise narrative.


-----
Below is a suggested report structure:

**Title** The title of your project and Group Name

**Abstract**. An abstract should concisely (less than 300 words) motivate the problem, describe your aims, describe your contribution, and highlight your main finding(s).

**Introduction** The introduction explains the problem, why it’s difficult, interesting, or important, how and why current methods succeed/fail at the problem, and explains the key ideas of your approach and results. Though an introduction covers similar material as an abstract, the introduction gives more space for motivation, detail, and references to existing work and captures the reader’s interest.

**Approach** This section details your approach(es) to the problem. For example, this is where you describe the architecture of your neural network(s), and any other key methods or algorithms.
* You should be specific when describing your main approaches – you probably want to include equations and figures.
* You should also describe your baseline(s). Depending on space constraints, and how standard your baseline is, you might do this in detail, or simply refer the reader to some other paper for the details.
* If any part of your approach is original, make it clear (so we can give you credit!). For models and techniques that aren’t yours, provide references.
* As you’re setting up equations, notation, and the like, be sure to agree on a fixed technical vocabulary (that you’ve defined, or is well-defined in the literature) before writing and use it consistently throughout the report! This will make it easier for the teaching team to follow and is nice practice for research writing in general.

**Experiments**. This section contains the following. 
* **Evaluation method**: If you’re defining your own metrics (for diagnostic purposes), be clear as to what you’re hoping to measure with each evaluation method (whether quantitative or qualitative, automatic or human-defined!), and how it’s defined.
* **Experimental details**: Report how you ran your experiments (e.g., model configurations, learning rate, training time, etc.)

**Results**: Report the quantitative results that you have found so far. Use a table or plot to compare results and compare against baselines. You must report dev results, and also test results if you participate in the leaderboard.
When analysing your results, consider the following: Are they what you expected?; Better than you expected?; Is It worse than you expected?; Why do you think that is?; What does that tell you about your approach?

**Conclusion**. Summarise the main findings of your project, and what you have learnt. Highlight your achievements, and note the primary limitations of your work. If you like, you can describe avenues for future work.

**Team contributions** (doesn't count towards the page limit) If you are a multi-person team, briefly describe the contributions of each member of the team.

**References** (doesn't count towards the page limit) Your references section should be produced using BibTeX.

**Important:** The report must be a faithful description of the system you implemented.  
If there is a mismatch between the report and the submitted code, marks will be deducted.

A strong report not only presents results, but also provides clear insight into *why* the method works (or fails).

**Submission:** LMS Assignment Submission Box will be opened from 28 April 2026.

**You Must Submit Two Files:**
- **pdf file** (filename format: COMP90042_teamname.pdf): a report using the [ACL template](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).

- **zip file** (filename format: COMP90042_teamname_resource.zip): A zip file containing:
  1) ipynb file(s) (**You MUST use the provided [ipynb template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CjlVXdEsioH_iGOHUbmrhimTLRXGJIt0?usp=sharing)**)  
  2) a README file describing how to run the code (if it's not apparent from the documentation in the ipynb files) *(optional)*  
  3) any shell scripts used to run your code (e.g., for package installation) *(optional)*  

  **Note:** You **MUST NOT** upload any data files or trained model checkpoints. Your code must run successfully in the Colab environment and reproduce the reported results.


**Your submissions will be graded as follows:**
| Component  | Criteria | Description  | Marks |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Writing  | Clarity  | Is the report well-written and well-structured?  | 3  |
| Writing  | Tables/Figures  | Are tables and figures interpretable and used effectively?  | 4  |
| Content  | Soundness  | Are the methods technically sound and well-justified?  | 8  |
| Content  | Substance  | How much work is done? Is there sufficient depth and effort?  | 5  |
| Content  | Novelty  | How novel or ambitious are the techniques or methods? How original and well-justified are the design choices? | 6  |
| Content  | Results  | Are the results and findings convincing? Are the results critically analysed and interpreted?  | 6  |
| Scholarship  | Citation  | Does the report cite relevant publications to drive decision making (e.g. to motivate design choices or to support findings)?   | 3 |
| **Total**  |   |  | **35**  |

**Note:** For projects using LLMs, marks will be awarded based on the originality of system design and the clarity of justification, rather than simply using a pretrained model.
Submissions that rely solely on off-the-shelf models without clear system design and analysis will be considered weak.
